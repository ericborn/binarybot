# BinaryBot
The goal of this project was to create a bot that was capable of fully autonomous play of the game StarCraft 2. During the project I learned about utilizing Numpy for saving and loading data, constructing Neural nets with TensorFlow and Keras, utilizing both local and cloud GPU's, analyzing data in real-time and working with Linux.

In the game of StarCraft 2 there is no one set way to victory and since my end goal was to create a flexible bot that developed its own playstyle and strategy, I decided to try to accomplish this by having the bot's actions be controlled by a neural net. I went with a neural net implementation utilizing LSTM, long short-term memory, which is a type of neural network that has a type of built in memory function. Since a neural net needs to study large amounts of data to improve itself, I first created a bot that would generate game data and used it to train the net. After training and saving out a model, I implemented it into the binary bot to read real-time data and chose in-game actions. 

Unfortunately, the neural net does not play the game all that well. The bot does analyze real-time data and sometimes makes varying decisions, but often choses the same action repeatedly until its destroyed. To improve its play, I implemented a system which if the bot chooses the same action 5 times in a row, instead of carrying out that action, a random action is used instead. This adds significant improvements to the botâ€™s performance, but defeats the overall purpose of the neural net being the key decision maker.
